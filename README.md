# TRINIT_HackElite_ML01
Our goal is to deign a chatbot which helps people during Covid to connect with the doctors and other health care workers around us. We have developed a chatbot which helps us to carry out most of the things that we would require . Many are the sources linked with the cahtbot for the facilitation of the people . Please go through the link below for the demo for the project.
