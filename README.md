PS - During this pandemic, the healthcare industry has developed rapidly in order to combat covid in the best way possible. One can have several questions regarding Covid-19 and one's health which should be addressed quickly. However, doctors and healthcare workers have been working on the frontline, due to which, they cannot answer these questions for everyone. In order to tackle the problem, you have to design a chatbot that will answer all people's questions related to Covid-19.

Our goal is to deign a chatbot which helps people during Covid to connect with the doctors and other health care workers around us. We have developed a chatbot which helps us to carry out most of the things that we would require . Many are the sources are linked with the chatbot for the facilitation of the people . Please go through the link below for the demo for the project. We have added a website for booking the ration online and re-directed the pages wherever needed
